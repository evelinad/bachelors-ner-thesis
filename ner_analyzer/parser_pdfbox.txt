Poverty and Economic Polarization
Among Children in Racial Minority
and Immigrant Families
DANIEL T. LICHTER, ZHENCHAO QIAN, 
AND MARTHA L. CROWLEY
R ecent trends in child poverty andinequality can only be fully under-stood in light of America’s growing
racial and ethnic diversity, fueled largely by
the massive new immigration from Latin
America and Asia. Indeed, the racial and 
ethnic fabric of the United States changed
substantially during the last half of the 20th
century. In 1950, for example, the U.S.
Census Bureau reported that 134 million, or
nearly 90% of America’s 151 million
people, were white.1 Blacks accounted for
significantly more than 90% of the remain-
ing nonwhite population (Gibson & Jung,
2002). Questions about race and inequality
were considered almost exclusively in terms
of black and white. The situation had
changed considerably by the turn of the 21st
century. Today, whites represent only 75%
of America’s population. Hispanics are now
America’s largest racial or ethnic minority—
at 12.5%—whereas the black population
has remained relatively constant at 10% to
12% since 1950.2 A diverse Asian popula-
tion accounts for about 4% of the U.S. pop-
ulation and comprises many different
nationalities (Barnes & Bennett, 2002;
Grieco & Cassady, 2001). Increasingly,
minority population shares are especially
apparent among children. Overall, in 2000,
nearly two of five children were members of
racial/ethnic minority groups or immigrant
families (Hernandez, 2004).
Growing diversity raises the need to
better monitor the changing economic
incorporation of minority children, includ-
ing immigrants, into American society.
Recent trends among children also raise
important new questions about racial strat-
ification and persistent inequality in
America’s future. Unfortunately, one study
after another has shown that poor children
have a high probability of becoming poor
adults because poverty is reproduced from
one generation to the next (Gottschalk,
1997; Lichter, 1997). Racial and ethnic
C H A P T E R

minorities also will represent a growing
share of the population relative to
America’s aging white population. Thus,
high rates of child poverty today, especially
among the children of racial minorities and
immigrants, may provide a portent of
America’s future—one characterized by
growing racial and economic inequality.3 It
is more important than ever to evaluate the
changing economic circumstances of
America’s increasingly diverse population
of children. Such is our purpose.
In this chapter, we have two primary goals.
First, we document changes in child poverty
rates between 1990 and 2000 for different
racial and ethnic groups. Like other studies
(Lichter & Landale, 1995; Manning &
Brown, 2006), we emphasize the role of
family structure, including the rise in cohabi-
tation, and increasing maternal employment
in shaping children’s economic circumstances.
But we also highlight the new patterns of
racial and ethnic variation in children’s recent
experiences. Second, unlike most previous
studies, we evaluate children’s changing 
location in the family income distribution 
(see Lichter & Eggebeen, 1993). Specifically,
is there a growing gap between rich and poor
children, and has this gap been reinforced by
growing racial diversity and immigration over
the past decade? These dual objectives are
addressed using data from the 5% samples of
1990 and 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples
from the U.S. Decennial Censuses.
CHILD POVERTY AND 
RACIAL INEQUALITY
According to Bianchi (1999), poverty in
America has become increasingly “juve-
nilized” during the past three decades. In the
1960s, child poverty rates were only about
three-fifths as high as poverty rates among
the elderly, but they were more than 80%
higher in the early 1990s.4 The economic
roller coaster of the 1990s and early 2000s
has also ushered in a new period of uncer-
tainty in the family and economic lives of
America’s children (Lichter & Qian, 2004;
Thomas & Sawhill, 2005). Poverty rates
among children residing in the United States
peaked during the 1993 recession, but subse-
quently declined by the end of the 1990s to
their lowest levels (17.1%) in 20 years (U.S.
Census Bureau, 2007a). Although this is wel-
come news, these national changes reflect the
balance of poverty trends across a variety of
population subgroups, including children in
America’s minority and immigrant families
(Lichter & Crowley, 2004; Van Hook,
Brown, & Kwenda, 2004). As such, they
may conceal divergence among subgroups of
children, some of which may not have
benefited from the economic largesse 
of the 1990s.
Effective public policy aimed at reducing
child poverty depends on improving our
understanding of the forces underlying recent
trends and racial differentials in child poverty.
An Urban Institute report claimed that the
1996 welfare reform bill would doom an
additional 1 million children to poverty
(Zedlewski, Clark, Meier, & Watson, 1996).
Clearly, these early forecasts have not materi-
alized. Even the most prescient observers
could not have anticipated the swift increase
in employment rates among single mothers,
from 60% in 1994 to 72% in 1999 (Moffitt,
2002). Recent estimates suggest that rising
maternal employment, which some experts
attribute to state “work first” welfare pro-
grams, may have accounted for as much as
50% of the post-1996 decline in poverty
among children living in female-headed
families (Lichter & Crowley, 2004). A bur-
geoning economy also played a large role. For
example, Iceland (2003) and Gunderson and
Ziliak (2004) showed that macroeconomic
growth was strongly linked to declines in
poverty during the 1990s. On the whole, it
seems that economic growth, including rising
PART II: POVERTY AMONG DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND SETTINGS120
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  11:59 AM  Page 120
maternal employment, has played a large 
role in shaping children’s shifting economic
circumstances.5
Changing family structure and child
poverty have been inextricably linked during
the past 40 years. In the 1960s, for example,
most poor children lived with two parents
who were married. By the end of the 1990s,
57% of poor children lived in female-headed
families (U.S. Census Bureau, 2007b).
Eggebeen and Lichter (1991) showed that
about one-half of the rise in child poverty
during the 1980s was caused by shifts in the
child population from married-couple
families to “high risk” female-headed families
(cf. Cancian & Reed, 2002; Lerman, 1996;
Thomas & Sawhill, 2002). The good news is
that changes in family structure slowed signif-
icantly in the 1990s and were no longer
associated with increases in poverty, even
among children (Iceland, 2003; Lichter &
Crowley, 2004). One policy implication is 
that any further reductions in child poverty
may require more government, community,
and faith-based efforts to promote marriage
and strengthen fragile families. Indeed, the
current Republican administration, through
the Administration for Children and Families
(ACF), has sponsored a “Healthy Marriage
Initiative” that aims to stem unwed childbear-
ing and help sustain healthy marital
relationships, mostly through marriage edu-
cation (e.g., relationship skills training) and
counseling.
The negative economic implications of
single parenthood and positive implications of
maternal work in the 1990s for children's eco-
nomic well-being have been unmistakable.
Whether these patterns are also found among
various racial and ethnic minorities or immi-
grant groups, however, is less clear. Despite
declines in child poverty in the 1990s, large
racial and ethnic differences persist while racial
diversity in America has rapidly grown (Lichter,
Qian, & Crowley, 2005; Manning & Brown,
2006). The children of minority and immigrant
families have been affected in uncertain ways by
long-term increases in maternal employment
and family change. For example, the late 1990s
brought especially large employment increases
among African American single mothers, appar-
ently in response to work-based welfare reform
(Moffitt, 2002). On the other hand, inequality
between blacks and whites, as measured by dif-
ferences in child poverty, has been exacerbated
over recent decades by growing racial differ-
ences in family structure (Eggebeen & Lichter,
1991). Unlike the situation for American-
born blacks, differences in family structure
accounted for only a small part of large
Hispanic-white difference in child poverty dur-
ing the 1980s. For Hispanic children, and espe-
cially Mexican-origin children, a large part of
the poverty gap stems from differences in mater-
nal employment (i.e., Hispanic mothers have
lower employment rates).
Far less is known about the demographic
and economic foundations of changing
poverty rates among children in immigrant
families, or immigrant-native differences
(Crowley, Lichter, & Qian, 2006; Jensen &
Chitose, 1994). A recent study by Hernandez
(2004) showed that the poverty rate for
immigrants was 50% higher in 1999 than
was poverty among the native-born (21% vs.
14%). However, poverty rates among first-
and second-generation immigrants declined
slightly in the 1990s, after doubling (from
11.6% to 22.2%) during the preceding two
decades (Van Hook et al., 2004). This study
also reported that roughly one-half of the
increase in immigrant poverty between 1969
and 1999 was attributable to changing eco-
nomic conditions (as measured by parental
work patterns). Child poverty rates in 1999
varied from a low of 9.5% among non-
Hispanic whites to 32.9% among Mexicans.
In 2000, the poverty rate for immigrants who
entered the United States before 1970 was
8.3%. Rates for those arriving in the 1970s,
1980s, and 1990s were 11.5%, 15.2%, and
23.5%, respectively (Lichter & Crowley,
Poverty and Economic Polarization Among Children in Racial Minority and Immigrant Families 121
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  11:59 AM  Page 121
2002). These differences in poverty reflect the
fact that recently arrived immigrants tend to
be of childbearing age, are poorly educated,
have fewer English language skills, and often
lack the job skills necessary to avoid poverty.
Measured poverty may veil even greater eco-
nomic hardship if unsuccessful immigrants
have returned to their countries of origin.
The typically positive interpretation given
to widespread declines in child poverty dur-
ing the 1990s, however, must be interpreted
in light of America’s rising overall standard
of living (Eggebeen & Lichter, 1991;
Rainwater & Smeeding, 2004). By defini-
tion, poverty income thresholds, if measured
in constant dollars, have remained essentially
unchanged since they were first introduced in
the mid-1960s. Median family income, on
the other hand, has increased substantially.
Consequently, if compared with the national
standard of living, the poor have fallen more
deeply into poverty as the gap between aver-
age incomes of America’s poor people and its
middle-class and affluent people has grown
(Iceland, 2003). In 1966, for example, the
average income of the poorest one-fifth of
U.S. families expressed as a ratio to mean
family income was only .28. In other words,
the income of poor families was 72% lower
than the average U.S. family income. By
2001, the income of the poorest segment of
the population was 79% lower. During that
time, the mean income of the richest one-fifth
of U.S. families rose dramatically in relation
to the average family income—their income
was 103% higher in 1966, and 139% higher
in 2001 (see historical income figures in U.S.
Census Bureau, 2007c, 2007d).
As the incomes of America’s wealthiest
families have burgeoned and average family
incomes have grown, the U.S. government’s
poverty income thresholds have not kept
pace. In 1980, for example, the median
family income was 2.5 times greater than the
poverty income threshold for a family of 
four. By 2001, this figure had climbed to 2.8,
indicating that the increases in absolute poverty
thresholds have lagged behind the growth in
family income during the past two decades.
One implication is that America’s children
may be on two different tracks into adulthood
(e.g., Lichter & Eggebeen, 1993; McLanahan,
2004). One track is made up of poor and eco-
nomically disadvantaged children living with
single or divorced mothers or in two-parent
working families struggling to make ends meet
in a changing global economy. Many histori-
cally disadvantaged racial minorities and the
“new” immigrant children fall into this popu-
lation. A second track—so-called “cornucopia
kids”—are living with two highly educated
working parents. A disproportionately large
majority of such children are white. Rising
income inequality suggests that the economic
trajectories of children on these two tracks may
be diverging, despite widespread declines in
child poverty during the late 1990s. Our pri-
mary goal is to document racial differentials in
child poverty, while evaluating the potentially
divergent economic paths among America’s
racial and ethnic minority children, many of
whom are immigrants. The key question here
is not whether racial minority children and
immigrants are able to escape poverty but
whether they are joining the American eco-
nomic mainstream.
DATA AND MEASURES
Our analyses are based on 1990 and 
2000 data from the Integrated Public Use
Microdata Samples (IPUMS) drawn from the
decennial censuses (Ruggles et al., 2003).
Data were weighted to correct for underrep-
resented segments of the population, ensur-
ing a nationally representative sample that
includes minorities and immigrants.
Our sample is limited to children aged 17
and younger who are related to the head of
household, or whose parent is an unmarried
partner of the household head (or householder).
PART II: POVERTY AMONG DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND SETTINGS122

Children who head households or who are
married to household heads are excluded from
our analysis. Each child is linked to family and
parental information, including information on
their parents’ marital or cohabiting partners. A
small number of cases lacking basic demo-
graphic information for the head of household
are excluded from the sample. The total sample
includes 3,208,706 children in 1990 and
3,577,175 in 2000.
We also draw secondary samples for the
purpose of comparing the income distribu-
tions of families with and without children.
Individuals aged 12 to 59 not residing in
group quarters are weighted with the person
weight and aggregated to the level of the
household and then the family. This sample
includes 3,935,446 families in 1990 and
4,727,901 families in 2000. Children were
present in 51% of families in 1990 and 46%
of families in 2000.
Measures
Poverty and Inequality. Children are defined
as poor when they live in families with
incomes below the official poverty income
thresholds for families with their specific size
and configuration (i.e., adults and children),
as determined by the Office of Management
and Budget. Family income is measured in
the year before the year of enumeration. This
means that poverty status for 1990 and 2000
is based on money income and poverty
thresholds for 1989 and 1999, respectively.
Officially, poverty is based on income of
the family, but children may be living in
households in which family members and
nonfamily members pool incomes (Bauman,
1999; Carlson & Danziger, 1999). This is
sometimes the case for children living with a
cohabiting parent and partner. Nearly one in
seven children living with a single mother
actually resides with a cohabiting couple, and
43% of cohabiting couples live with children
(Lichter & Qian, 2004). In our analysis, we
redefine unmarried partners and their co-res-
ident children as a social family (see Manning
& Brown, 2006, for similar approach). We
supplement official child poverty statistics
with measures of child poverty adjusted for
these living arrangements. For each cohabit-
ing couple, we combine the household head’s
family income with that of the unmarried
partner, and then compare this income to the
appropriately adjusted poverty threshold (i.e.,
family size is adjusted upward to include the
cohabiting partner and any additional
children residing with them).
Race, Nativity Status, and Family Structure.
Race and ethnicity data were used to identify
five distinct subgroups of children: non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Native
American, Asian and Pacific Islander, and
Hispanic. With the exception of Native
Americans, immigrant children were defined
as those who are immigrants themselves 
(i.e., first-generation immigrants) or are the
children of one or two immigrant parents
(i.e., second-generation immigrants). Native
children who were born in the United States
to two native-born parents (i.e., third-genera-
tion) or who were born abroad to native-born
Americans were identified as natives (for sim-
ilar approach, see Hernandez, 2004; Van
Hook et al., 2004).
For the first time, individuals in the 2000
census were able to claim more than one race.
We used variables detailing Hispanic origins
and race combinations to classify those claim-
ing mixed race origins. Any person claiming
Hispanic origin was classified as Hispanic;
and any person claiming black, but not
Hispanic, origin was designated as non-
Hispanic black. Those claiming mixed white
race, but not black or Hispanic background,
were classified as non-Hispanic white. Asian-
origin and Native American individuals with
no specific black, Hispanic, or white claims
were labeled Asian and Native American
respectively. Depending on the analyses, we
Poverty and Economic Polarization Among Children in Racial Minority and Immigrant Families 123
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  11:59 AM  Page 123
also classify children as living in (a) married-
couple families, (b) various types of female-
headed families, and (c) cohabiting-couple
families (i.e., their unmarried parents are
cohabiting). Children in female-headed
families are further distinguished on the basis
of their mothers’ employment patterns during
the previous year. Women who usually
worked 35 or more hours per week were con-
sidered full-time workers; women who had
jobs but worked fewer than 35 hours were
labeled part-time. We also identified children
whose mothers were unemployed or not in
the labor force.
Analytic Strategy
The first segment of our analysis focuses on
racial differentials and changes in child
poverty during the 1990s, and uncovers the
extent to which they reflect new patterns of
maternal employment and family structure.
We use methods of direct standardization, as
described in the Categorical Data Analysis
System (CDAS), Version 3.5 (Eliason, 2002).
Child poverty rates are calculated as the
number of poor children divided by the total
number of children, multiplied by 100.
Overall poverty rates are the weighted sums of
group-specific poverty rates. The overall poverty
rate, for example, is equal to race-specific
poverty rates, weighted by race groups’ repre-
sentation in the overall population and then
summed. Thus, we can determine what the
overall poverty rate would be given a differ-
ently distributed population. We can calcu-
late, for example, what the 2000 poverty rate
would have been if family structure remained
unchanged since 1990 by applying 1990 pop-
ulation compositional “weights” to 2000
group-specific poverty rates.
By computing hypothetical poverty rates
absent changes in composition, and compar-
ing them to observed changes, we can demon-
strate the degree to which compositional
shifts (in family structure and maternal work)
affect poverty trends. Subtracting the differ-
ence between the crude and composition-
standardized rates from the difference in the
crude rates, then dividing the result by the dif-
ference in the crude rates, yields the propor-
tion of the crude rate change attributable to
shifts in population composition. We can
determine, for example, the degree to which
declines in poverty between 1990 and 2000
may be attributed to shifts in family structure.
The second element of our analysis
involves evaluating income growth and
the changing distribution of poverty and afflu-
ence across racial groups and various
subpopulations of America’s children and
families. Measures of income growth and
inequality are based on income-to-needs ratios
and their distribution across subgroups of
children. Income-to-needs ratios are calcu-
lated by dividing children’s family income by
their family-specific poverty income threshold.
An income-to-poverty ratio of 2.5 indicates
that the child lives in a family with an income
2.5 times its poverty threshold.6 Change in
children’s income inequality between 1990
and 2000 is measured with the ratio of the
80th to 20th percentiles in their income-to-
needs distribution.7 This provides a measure
of the gap between rich and poor children.
The ratio of the 50th to 20th percentiles
shows the income gap between poor children
and average children (i.e., children in families
with incomes at the median). These analyses
allow us to track changes in inequality within
and between groups.
RESULTS
Changes in Child Poverty,
1990 to 2000
Data in Table 8.1 highlight recent
changes in child poverty rates for whites,
African Americans, Native Americans, Asian
Americans, and Hispanics. In the 1990s,
PART II: POVERTY AMONG DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND SETTINGS124
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  11:59 AM  Page 124
child poverty rates declined from 17.8 to
16.1%. These declines were not uniform
across racial groups.8 Declines were modest
for non-Hispanic whites compared with
those of racial minority children. African
American children experienced declines in
poverty from 39% in 1990 to 32% in 2000,
and Native Americans had similarly large
declines in poverty. Any optimism implied by
substantial reductions in poverty over the
past decade must be balanced by the fact that
these minority children still had the highest
poverty rates in 2000. Asian Americans, on
the other hand, had the lowest poverty rate
of all racial minorities in 2000.
Our results also indicate that children of
immigrant families generally had higher
poverty rates than their native counterparts
did. Black children are the only group in
which the poverty rate was substantially
higher for natives than for immigrants.
Nativity differences were less dramatic
among Hispanics—undoubtedly reflecting
the disadvantaged socioeconomic status of
the native-born rather than upward mobility
of Hispanic immigrants. Moreover, with the
exception of Asians, trends in child poverty
during the 1990s were more advantageous
for natives than for immigrants. Among
blacks and Hispanics, poverty rates declined
faster for natives than for immigrants, and
among whites, immigrant poverty rates rose
whereas those of natives declined. For Asian
and Pacific Islanders, the child poverty rate
for immigrant children declined, while it
increased among the native born from 9.7%
in 1990 to 10.3% in 2000.
Family Structure and Changes in Child
Poverty. Child poverty is strongly associated
with family structure. Children in married-
couple families are much less likely to live in
poverty than are children in female-headed
families. This raises an obvious question: Did
declines in poverty reflect salutary changes in
family structure over the 1990s?
Table 8.1 provides official and stand-
ardized child poverty rates for 2000.
Standardized rates assume that children were
distributed across family types in 2000 as
they were in 1990. In other words, we imag-
ine what poverty rates might look like had
family structure not changed during the
1990s (i.e., the same shares of children lived
with married couples, cohabiting couples,
single male-headed families, single ever-
married female-headed families, and never-
married female-headed families). The results
indicate that child poverty would have
declined from 17.8% in 1990 (column 1) 
to about 15% in 2000 (column 3) in the
absence of changes in children’s living
arrangements. The observed decline in child
poverty during the 1990s was smaller.
Similar patterns are observed for all racial
groups except for Asian immigrants when we
standardize by 1990 race-specific family 
patterns. Thus, for the decade of the 1990s,
changes in family structure slowed the down-
ward trend in child poverty rates (cf. Lichter
& Crowley, 2004).
Column 4 presents standardized poverty
rates for 2000 using family structure of the
total population of children. In other words,
how would child poverty rates differ if all
children were uniformly distributed across
married-couple and single-parent families?
The results indicate that poverty rates would
be higher among whites and Asian Americans,
but lower among African Americans and
Native Americans. This means that whites and
Asian Americans are much more likely to live
in low risk married-couple families, whereas
African and Native Americans tend to live in
single-parent families, which typically have
high poverty rates. Child poverty rates for
Hispanics change little with standardization
because the family structure of Hispanic
children is close to the national average for all
children. Notably, Hispanic children of immi-
grant families are more likely than are third-
generation Hispanic children (i.e., those with
Poverty and Economic Polarization Among Children in Racial Minority and Immigrant Families 125
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  11:59 AM  Page 125
native-born parents) to live with two parents,
which places downward pressure on poverty
rates. The important point, however, is that
racial differences in family structure account
for some, but not all of the differences in child
poverty. For example, if black children lived in
married-couple families in the same propor-
tions as whites, their poverty rates would still
be nearly double those of white children.
More than ever before, evaluating
poverty among children living in single-
parent families is made difficult by rising
shares of children who also live with a
parent’s cohabiting partner (Lichter &
Crowley, 2004; Manning & Lichter, 1996).
Indeed, as shown in Table 8.2, our estimates
suggest that the share of children living in
cohabiting-couple families increased from
3.46 to 5.43% of all children between 1990
and 2000. Increases were apparent for all
racial minorities, and for both natives and
immigrants, during the 1990s. However,
children in immigrant families are less likely
than are children with native-born parents
(regardless of race) to live in cohabiting-
couple families. In 2000, the shares of non-
Hispanic black natives, Native Americans,
and native-born Hispanics in these types 
of families were well above the national
percentage.

Table 8.2 also includes the official
poverty rate for children living with cohab-
iting parents, and an adjusted rate (columns
5–6), based on the combined incomes of
each partner compared with an adjusted
poverty threshold (because of adding an
additional family member and any addi-
tional children residing with them). We
assume, perhaps unrealistically, that part-
ners pool their incomes to the benefit of 
co-residential children. By comparing the
official and adjusted poverty rates, we can
derive an upper-bound estimate of reduc-
tions in measured poverty if children’s
cohabiting partners married. Among all
children residing in cohabiting-couple
households, the 2000 child poverty rate
would drop from 35% to 20%.9 Reductions
are evident among all groups. At a mini-
mum, our results suggest that the official
poverty rate is overestimated as a family-
based measure, and has not kept pace with
children’s changing living arrangements,
especially the rise in the percentage of
children living with cohabiting couples.
The final two columns in Table 8.2 pre-
sent overall 1990 and 2000 child poverty
rates when adjusted poverty substitutes for
official poverty among children living in
cohabiting-couple families. By comparing
these adjusted rates to the overall official
rates presented in Table 8.1, we observe the
effects of cohabitation on national estimates
of child poverty. In 2000, the adjusted
poverty rate was 15.26%, compared with an
observed rate 16.07% (Table 8.1). The dif-
ferences were also small for each race and
nativity group. The measurement effects of
cohabitation on overall child poverty rates
are minimal. But they became larger during
the 1990s with the rise in children living in
such families.
Maternal Employment and Poverty Among
Children in Female-Headed Families.
Children living in female-headed families
have much higher poverty rates than do
children living in married-couple families
(Lichter & Crowley, 2004). Still, even among
this disadvantaged population subgroup,
racial differences in child poverty remain
large. As shown in Table 8.3, poverty rates
among children living in female-headed sin-
gle families ranged from a high of more than
one-half of immigrant Hispanic children
(52%) to a low of less than 28% among
white children with immigrant parents in
2000. The good news is that poverty rates for
all such “at risk” children declined by nearly
10 percentage points (from 49 to 40%) dur-
ing the 1990s, and economic gains are evi-
dent among all race and nativity groups. Yet,
with the exception of Asians, poverty rates of
children residing with native-born single
mothers declined much more rapidly than
among children with immigrant single
mothers. For example, poverty among white
children with native single mothers declined
from 37% in 1990 to 29% in 2000, but
declined far less—from 30% to 28%—
among those with immigrant single mothers.
Although these recent declines are encourag-
ing, poverty rates among children living in
female-headed families remain high by
almost any standard.
Recent declines in poverty among children
living in female-headed families imply that
family changes alone cannot explain recent
declines in child poverty. Previous studies
indicate that changing maternal employment
may have played a large role in the changing
economic fortunes of such children (Lichter,
Qian, & Crowley, 2005; Manning &
Brown, 2006). Column 3 of Table 8.3 shows
the standardized child poverty rate in 2000
using the 1990 race-specific employment
rates of single mothers as the standard.
Poverty among children living with single
mothers would have declined to 43% rather
than 40% if there were no change in mater-
nal employment patterns during the 1990s.
In other words, the rise in maternal
PART II: POVERTY AMONG DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND SETTINGS128
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  12:00 PM  Page 128
employment accounted for about one-third of
the observed 9-percentage-point decline in
poverty for children in single-mother families
([42.93–39.83] × 100 / [49.06–39.83]).
Increases in maternal employment in the
1990s seem to have lifted many “at risk”
children out of poverty.
Recent employment patterns among sin-
gle mothers, however, had different effects
on children of different racial and ethnic
groups (Table 8.3). Among white children
with native-born parents, the rise in mater-
nal employment accounted for 33% of the
8-percentage-point decline in child poverty
during the 1990s. For black and Native
American children living in native-born
single-mother families, the rise in employ-
ment accounted for about 31 to 32% of the
roughly 12-percentage-point declines in
child poverty. Rising maternal employment
accounted for 47% of the decline among
native-born Hispanics.
Among children residing with single immi-
grant mothers, however, maternal employ-
ment patterns can explain little of the recent
changes in poverty. For example, changing

maternal work patterns explain almost none
of the 2- to 3-percentage-point poverty decline
among children of white and black immi-
grant families. And, for children in immigrant
Hispanic families, declines in child poverty
during the 1990s would have been greater if
1990 maternal employment patterns had con-
tinued in 2000. Although welfare reform
appears to have improved some children’s
economic circumstances by pressuring more
single mothers to enter the labor force, this has
not been the case for immigrant children.
Do differences in maternal employment
account for racial and ethnic differences 
in female-headed families’ rates of child
poverty? To answer this question, we calcu-
late employment-standardized child poverty
for 2000. These figures assume that maternal
employment patterns among single mothers
in each racial group are identical to those of
all single mothers. Our results indicate that
racial differences in child poverty (column 2)
are not simply the result of racial differences
in the work habits of children’s mothers.
Blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics—
regardless of nativity status—would have
much higher rates of child poverty than
would non-Hispanic white or Asian children,
even if maternal employment rates were the
same for each racial group. Other explana-
tions must be considered (e.g., differences in
wage rates caused by low education, limited
opportunities, or discrimination).
To sum up, recent declines in poverty
rates among children living in single-parent
families have been welcome news. Still, racial
differences in child poverty remain large,
with nearly half of all such African
American, Hispanic, and Native American
children living in poverty in 2000. Two
countervailing factors have shaped recent
trends in poverty—family instability and
maternal employment. Differentials in child
poverty rates were given impetus by the
racial differences in female-headed families
with children. On the other hand, maternal
employment among single mothers increased
rapidly in the 1990s, which provided an
important hedge against child poverty for
most groups considered here. However,
employment differences alone cannot explain
differences in poverty rates across racial or
immigrant groups of children.
Changes in Income Inequality
Among America’s Children
The 1990s brought declines in child
poverty rates for most racial, ethnic, and
immigrant groups. But a narrow focus on
declining poverty rates may cause us to over-
look evidence that poor children may be
poorer today than in the past, or that the
incomes of poor children may have increased
in absolute terms but declined relative to 
rising incomes of middle-class and affluent
children. In other words, did income inequal-
ity among children increase (or decrease)
during the 1990s as the income gap between
poor and rich children widened (or nar-
rowed)? Has growing racial diversity rein-
forced income inequality during the past
decade? And has the racial distribution of
affluent children become “whiter” whereas
the poor increasingly comprise children of
racial minority and immigrant families?
Income-to-Poverty Ratios. We begin with
simple comparisons of trends in children’s
family incomes over the 1990s. Table 8.4
presents income-to-needs ratios for the over-
all population and for each racial and nativ-
ity group. Overall, the family incomes of
poor children (i.e., children at the 20th per-
centile) increased from 10% over (1.10
times) the poverty threshold in 1990 to 19%
over (1.19 times) the threshold in 2000.
Income-to-needs ratios increased from 2.50
to 2.61 among children at the median of
family income (i.e., the “middle class”), and
from 4.31 to 4.74 among children at the 
top of the income distribution.
PART II: POVERTY AMONG DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND SETTINGS130
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  12:00 PM  Page 130
Evidence of whether income inequality
increased in the 1990s is reflected in the ratio
of the family income at the 80th percentile to
the family income at the 20th percentile (last
two columns, Table 8.4; see Danziger &
Gottschalk, 2004, for similar approach). 
A higher ratio indicates greater income
inequality. The ratio of income of affluent to
poor children increased only slightly in the
1990s, from 3.92 to 3.98. In other words,
affluent children have roughly 4 times as
much family income as poor children. Based
on this measure, there is little indication of
large increases in income inequality among
children in the 1990s.10
Our examination of racial and nativity
differences in income and income inequality
suggests at least three main conclusions.
First, and perhaps most significant, the aver-
age family incomes of children at the bottom
of the income distribution increased during
the 1990s for each of the racial and immi-
grant groups considered here. Quite simply,
the poor did not become absolutely poorer
during the 1990s; indeed, their incomes
grew. At the same time, income growth was
also apparent at the 50th and 80th percentile
for these groups of children, which raises
questions concerning differentials in income
growth across the income distribution (an
issue to which we will return).
Second, racial and nativity differences in
family income remain very large at each loca-
tion in the income distribution. For example,
for non-Hispanic white children at the 20th
income percentile, their family income was
66% higher than the poverty income thresh-
old. Among their non-Hispanic black coun-
terparts, incomes were 39% lower than the
poverty threshold. Clearly, America’s poorest
African American children are much poorer
than America’s poorest white children. Poor
children of immigrant families (for each racial
group except blacks) are poorer than poor
children with native-born parents. At the
other end of the income distribution, affluent
white and Asian children, not surprisingly,
had much higher incomes than the most afflu-
ent black, Native American, or Hispanic
natives or immigrants (column 6, Table 8.4).
Third, for historically disadvantaged
children, such as blacks, Native Americans,
and Hispanics, income inequality decreased in
the 1990s (except for black immigrants). This
is indicated by the increasing ratio of the race-
specific median incomes to the overall U.S.
median income (columns 7–8). This also is
indicated by the declining ratios of incomes at
the 80th to the 20th percentiles. For example,
among non-Hispanic blacks, the group with
the highest income inequality, the incomes of
affluent children were 6.6 times higher than
the incomes of poor children (at the 20th per-
centile) in 1990. However, this figure declined
to 5.4 by 2000. The decline reflects faster
income growth (on a percentage basis) at the
bottom than at the top of the income distribu-
tion for racial minority children. For these
minority children, declines in child poverty
during the 1990s were accompanied by the
growth of income among poor children and
declines in income inequality. This appears to
be a significant departure from the results of
past studies based on pre-1990 data (e.g.,
Lichter & Eggebeen, 1993).
Distribution of Poverty and Affluence.
We have described income growth among
poor, middle-class, and affluent children 
and changing inequality among racial and
immigrant groups. But any interpretation of
income growth must also consider the 
changing percentages of children in particu-
lar income classes. Indeed, it may be the case
that more poor children are deeply impover-
ished today, or that poor children who
escape poverty remain in families with mod-
est incomes (i.e., the “near poor”). Any opti-
mism implied by increases in income among
poor children must be tempered if the 
percentage of poor and near poor increased
during the past decade. A similarly less

sanguine interpretation is required of income
gains among the middle class or affluent if
the percentage of middle-class or affluent
children declined during the 1990s.
In this section, we calculate the percentage
of children in deep poverty, which includes
children in families with incomes less than
one-half their poverty income threshold.
Marginal poverty includes children with
family incomes that are at least one-half, but
less than 100% of their poverty threshold.
Children in nonpoor families with incomes
less than double their poverty threshold 
are included in the near poverty category.
Children with family incomes at least four
times their poverty threshold are considered
affluent for our purposes. Middle-class
children fall between the near poor and afflu-
ent, with family incomes that are at least dou-
ble, but less than four times their family’s
poverty income threshold.
Overall, the percentage of children living
in deep poverty declined from 8.3% in 1990
to 6.9% in 2000 (Figure 8.1). However, the
percentage in marginal poverty or near
poverty remained largely unchanged in the
1990s. The implication is significant: Overall
declines in child poverty during the 1990s
apparently reflected mostly the declining per-
centage of the most impoverished children.
At the same time, the middle-class share
declined slightly, chiefly because of increases
in the share of affluent children.
Racial and nativity comparisons reveal
some interesting facts. First, the percentage 
of children living in deep poverty generally
declined in the 1990s, especially among African
American children. Second, the percentage of
children in near poverty increased for all
groups except for native-born white, immi-
grant black, and immigrant Asian children.
One implication is that increases may reflect
declines in poverty as the poor have moved 
to the near-poor category. Third, among 
the most disadvantaged groups, including
blacks, Native Americans, and Hispanics, the
poor and near poor outnumber the middle
class and affluent. In 2000, 65% of Hispanic
immigrants, and 60% of black natives and
Native Americans, were poor or near poor,
and 35 and 40 percent, respectively, were mid-
dle class or affluent. Fourth, the percentage of
children living in affluence increased among
every race/ethnic and nativity category. Not
only did the income of the affluent increase,
but also the share of affluent children increased.
Fifth, among Hispanics and Asians, children
in immigrant families had lower rates of afflu-
ence, but black and white immigrants had
higher rates of affluence than their native
counterparts. Among Hispanic immigrants,
for example, only 8% were affluent in 2000—
the smallest share of any race and nativity
combination. Native-born Asians, on the other
hand, had the highest rates of affluence—45%
in 2000. These racial and immigrant differ-
ences in poverty and affluence clearly reveal
inequality among American children.
Not surprisingly, these large racial and
nativity differences in economic well-being
reveal themselves in striking differences in
the racial composition of the deeply poor,
marginally poor, near-poor, middle-class,
and affluent child populations. Figure 8.2
reveals that in 2000 the majority (more than
two-thirds) of deeply poor children were
racial minorities. Moreover, the small decline
during the 1990s in the percentage of deeply
poor children who were white or black was
offset by increases in the percentage of
Hispanic. By contrast, only 20% of affluent
children in 2000 were racial minorities—
with roughly equal shares of Asians, Hispanics,
and blacks.
Figure 8.3 presents the changes in the per-
centage of children in female-headed
families across the five income classes. The
most striking finding is that most children in
female-headed families—nearly 70%—are
included in either deep poverty, marginal
poverty, or near poverty. Although the share
of these children in middle-class or affluent

families increased in the 1990s, they never-
theless represent a very small proportion 
of such children. A similar conclusion
applies to most of the groups considered
here. Among native black, immigrant
Hispanic, and Native American children,
only a small fraction (about 20%) is middle
class or affluent.

Moreover, declines in deep and marginal
poverty typically were offset by increases in
the share of children who were near poor.
Indeed, the near-poor category increased its
population share by an amount equal to
41% of the decline in the share of poor
children. The implication, of course, is that
much of the decline in child poverty among
female-headed families reflects shifts to near
poverty rather than significant shifts to the
middle class. Population shifts out of the
near-poor category into the middle class
likely deflate the true degree to which entry
into the near-poor category offsets declines
in poverty. In sum, many children in single-
mother families moved out of poverty during
the 1990s but few moved into the middle
class. Indeed, most of these children remain
economically disadvantaged but are not
acknowledged as such in official government
poverty statistics.
Changes in Family
Poverty and Affluence
We have focused our attention on racial
and immigrant differences in poverty among
children with different living arrangements.
But how have families with children com-
pared with those headed by similarly aged
householders without children? Has the gap
in economic well-being expanded during the
1990s as the proportion of families remain-
ing childless has grown? We address these
questions with 1990 and 2000 data on
poverty for families with children (Figure 8.4)
and without children (Figure 8.5).11
Overall, families without children were
more likely than were families with children to
be at the extremes of the income distribution.
For example, a higher and growing percentage
of families without children lived in deep
poverty (8.1% in 1990 and 9.6% in 2000).
For families with children, the comparable
percentages of deep poverty were roughly 
one-half as large and declining—5.9% in
1990 and 5.2% in 2000. Roughly 40% of
families without children were affluent both in
1990 and 2000. The percent of affluent
families with children was lower but increased
from 33% to 35% during the 1990s.
Similar patterns of inequality between
families with and without children were appar-
ent across racial groups.12 That is, a larger

share of families without children lived in deep
poverty and in affluence. The one exception is
Asian American families—the percent affluent
is higher among Asian families with children
than among their childless counterparts. In
fact, more than one-half of native Asian
American families with children were affluent,
a percentage exceeding even that of whites.
Racial differences in poverty also tend to be
smaller when families rather than children are

This is attributable partly to family size and
composition differences among families of
different races and socioeconomic statuses.
Analyses of families give equal weight to each
family whereas analyses of children weigh
families by family size, which is positively asso-
ciated with poverty.13

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The 1990s ushered in a new period of grow-
ing racial and ethnic diversity in the United
States. More than ever before, recent trends
also have highlighted the need to better eval-
uate new patterns of economic incorporation
of America’s historically disadvantaged
children of racial minority and immigrant
families. As we have argued here, the current

economic circumstances of America’s minor-
ity children provide a window to the future
of racial stratification and inequality. Our
primary objective therefore has been to track
trends in child poverty and income inequality
among diverse minority groups over the
1990s. The 1990 and 2000 5% Public Use
Microdata Samples provide samples of
children of sufficient size and racial diversity
to achieve this objective.
At the national level, our results indicate
that the 1990s were a period of widespread
declines in poverty among America’s
children. Each of the racial and ethnic groups
considered here appears to have benefited
from economic and employment growth dur-
ing the 1990s. Indeed, our results suggest
that increasing maternal employment rather
than changing family structure accounted for
the largest share of the recent declines in
child poverty. Unlike the pre-1990 period,
when children’s living arrangements shifted
them away from married-couple families to
high-risk single-parent families, the 1990s
brought little change in children’s living
arrangements (Lichter & Crowley, 2004;
Iceland, 2003). Changing family structure is
no longer giving demographic impetus to
increasing poverty among children. Rather,
the rise in maternal employment, especially
among single mothers, has placed consider-
able downward pressure on child poverty
rates nationally and across the population
subgroups of minority children and children
of immigrant families considered here (cf.,
Lichter & Crowley, 2004).14
We began with the assumption that
national trends in child poverty could 
mask tremendous racial and ethnic diversity
in children’s economic circumstances. Our
results, not surprisingly, do not lend them-
selves to simple conclusions. On the one
hand, maternal employment played a large
role in accounting for declines in child
poverty among minority children. On the
other hand, high rates of poverty among
children of minority and immigrant families
cannot be explained away by existing dif-
ferences in employment rates or work pat-
terns among children’s mothers. Conversely,
although changes in family structure cannot
fully explain trends in child poverty across
population subgroups, racial differences in
family structure continue to account for a
significant portion of observed differences in
child poverty across minority groups. Our
results confirm the view that racial inequality
among children cannot be discussed in isola-
tion from the currently large group differ-
ences in out-of-wedlock childbearing,
marriage, and divorce.15
At the same time, any analysis of trends
and differentials in child poverty, if consid-
ered alone, may give a rather incomplete or
even misleading picture of children’s chang-
ing economic circumstances. Significantly,
our results indicate that family incomes of
America’s poorest children, regardless of
racial or ethnic background, increased dur-
ing the 1990s at the same time poverty rates
declined. Rates of deep poverty (i.e., below
one-half of the poverty income threshold)
also declined among children and families
with children. Moreover, the growth in
income inequality among children (e.g.,
Lichter & Eggebeen, 1993) apparently
slowed significantly during the 1990s. These
results provide a different picture than por-
trayed recently by McLanahan (2004), who
suggested that the economic trajectories and
resources of rich and poor children are now
diverging. As we reported here, the family-
size-adjusted incomes of the poorest children
for most racial and ethnic groups increased
at a similar or faster pace over the past
decade than did the incomes of “average” or
wealthy children (see Table 8.3). Yet, by def-
inition, the absolute dollar gap in income
between America’s poor and affluent
children increased during the 1990s.
Whether trends and racial differences 
in poverty and income during the 1990s
should be viewed largely with optimism or
pessimism is a matter of personal judgment or
Poverty and Economic Polarization Among Children in Racial Minority and Immigrant Families 139

emphasis. There can be no disagreement,
however, that racial and nativity differences
in economic well-being remain large in the
United States. And few observers will disagree
that any progress toward racial inequality 
has been slow, or that continuing high rates
of child poverty today will reinforce existing
patterns of racial inequality in the future.
Only by severing the link between childhood
and adult poverty (e.g., through better 
education, a secure safety net, or economic
opportunity) will America’s future take a
different or faster route toward racial 
economic equality.

NOTES
1. Among the white population, only a small share was of Hispanic origin.
Although data on Hispanic origin are not available from the 1950 census, the 1940
census indicated that 116 million of the 118 million white people were non-
Hispanic in origin (Gibson & Jung, 2002). The heavy influx of Hispanics from
Mexico and other Latin American countries did not begin until the 1960s.  
2. The 2000 census indicates that nearly 35 million blacks lived in the United
States, or roughly 12.3% of the total population (Grieco & Cassady, 2001).
3. Previous studies have demonstrated that childhood poverty compromises
development trajectories, academic achievement, and social mobility. See Duncan and
Brooks-Gunn’s (1997) compendium of studies on the consequences of poverty for
children’s development.
4. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income
and Program Participation, Iceland, Short, Garner, and Johnson (2001) found that
child poverty rates continued to surpass those of other age groups, but that the gap
between child and adult poverty rates is smaller when income calculations include
noncash government benefits and the Earned Income Tax Credit.
5. From 1949 to 1969, Gottschalk and Danziger (1993) demonstrated that the
large decline in poverty (–25.7 percentage points) were entirely attributable to
changes in the economy. The subsequent period, from 1973 to 1991, showed little
relationship between economic change and poverty. 
6. We assume that the poverty income threshold for any given child represents
need. Significantly, the income-to-poverty ratio also adjusts for family size and config-
uration—increasing with family size to reflect increased need and economies of scale.
7. The IPUMS family income-to-needs ratio is top coded at 5.01. Calculating
80th percentiles required us to replace top-coded values with our own income-to-needs
computations, based on information about family income, size, and configuration.
8. Some additional analyses revealed that the child poverty rate would have
declined to 14.9% (rather than 16.1%) during the 1990s if the racial/ethnic compo-
sition of the child population had remained unchanged after 1990. America’s chang-
ing racial composition has put upward demographic pressure on child poverty rates.
At the same time, the effects of changing immigrant composition on child poverty
were modest. In the absence of changes between 1990 and 2000 in the share of first-,
second-, and third-generation children, the child poverty rate in 1990 would have
been 15.7% (rather than 16.1%).
9. Similar results are reported in a recent study by Manning and Brown
(2006). They showed that the poverty rate was 7.6% for children living in married-
couple families with both biological parents. For children living with cohabiting
parents, the rates were 19.0 and 23.0%, respectively, for children living with both 
08-Crane (Handbook)-45351.qxd  9/18/2007  12:00 PM  Page 140
biological parents or living with a biological parent and unrelated partner. Their
analyses were based on the 1999 National Survey of American Families. 
10. Conclusions about changing income inequality may be different if we com-
pared other income percentiles, such as the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile.
Blanket conclusions about changes in inequality based on these ratios are inappro-
priate. Income ratios and income differences among children at different locations
in the income distribution may yield different interpretations. Our ratio measure in
Table 8.3 indicates little change in income inequality during the 1990s. Absolute dif-
ferences in income-to-poverty ratios of the poor and affluent, however, indicate
large increases in inequality. 
11. To be comparable, our sample of families without children includes only
those in which the householder is 59 years old or younger. 
12. Our secondary family samples were also classified by race. We categorized
each family member’s race as we did for children. But because children’s race is
often consistent with the mother’s racial identification, we placed priority on adult
females’ race. For consistency, we did the same for families without children. In
aggregating the sample, we selected the racial classification for the first-encountered
adult female, adult male, female child, and male child, and our final family racial
classification placed priority on racial identity in this order. If an adult female was
present, our family race label reflects that person’s race (or the race of the first adult
female encountered in that family). If no adult female was present, our race variable
reflects the first adult male encountered, and so on. 
13. For example, a poor single mother with three children yields one poor
family but three poor children. 
14. Our analysis probably underestimates the effect of employment. It does not
take into account the benefits of expansions in the Earned Income Tax Credit.
15. It is important to remember that eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in
work and family will not completely end racial and ethnic economic inequality.
These two factors are only part of the explanation and, as such, we must continue
to look for additional explanations (e.g., low pay, discrimination).
