               An explanation of the output:
Iter           The number of iterations
evals          The number of function evaluations
SCALING        <D> Diagonal scaling was used; <I> Scaled Identity
LINESEARCH     [## M steplength]  Minpack linesearch
                   1-Function value was too high
                   2-Value ok, gradient positive, positive curvature
                   3-Value ok, gradient negative, positive curvature
                   4-Value ok, gradient negative, negative curvature
               [.. B]  Backtracking
VALUE          The current function value
TIME           Total elapsed time
|GNORM|        The current norm of the gradient
{RELNORM}      The ratio of the current to initial gradient norms
AVEIMPROVE     The average improvement / current value
EVALSCORE      The last available eval score
